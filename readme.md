# Machine Learning

This project was created to support my journey in learning Machine Learning. 

It will serve as a platform where I can develop small Machine Learning projects to solidify my understanding of the essential concepts required to become proficient in this field. Although I have taken this approach before, this time I will be documenting the concepts I learn. 

This will not only help reinforce my understanding through recall but also serve as reference material as I progress. I've noticed that many concepts, such as gradient descent, can be applied to multiple Machine Learning architectures, making this documentation particularly valuable.

# Introduction
Hello, I'm Ashley, a Digital Project Engineering Consultant working at a boutique consulting firm in Canberra, Australia.

# Professional Background
In my professional role, I engage in various projects, predominantly in the realm of digital transformation. This involves modernising legacy systems for governments and industry by leveraging cutting-edge technology to architect and build new systems that enhance efficiency and introduce novel features.

# Personal Projects
During my free time, I typically immerse myself in side projects involving:
* Robotics and electronics using Raspberry Pis and Arduinos
* 3D printing and CAD with Fusion 360
* Developing APIs with Express and Single Page Applications (SPAs) using React and TypeScript

# Machine Learning Journey
Over the past eight months, I've been exploring the world of Machine Learning, particularly focusing on:
* Single and Multivariate Linear Regression
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Custom Object Detection

I've primarily utilised public datasets from Kaggle to understand how different algorithms and architectures function. Once I've grasped the fundamentals, I've applied this knowledge to my own datasets to solve trivial problems. I've found great enjoyment in working on these challenges and learning about Machine Learning.

# Learning Approach
My preferred learning method involves applying newfound knowledge to small projects. This combination of discovery and application has served me well in the past, which is one of the reasons you're reading this now.

# Motivation for Learning Machine Learning
Another motivation for my journey into Machine Learning is its rapid advancement, particularly in areas like Large Language Models (LLMs). I believe Machine Learning will play an even greater role in our society in the near future than it already does.

# Purpose of Documentation
This documentation serves as a tool to help me recall and solidify what I've learnt. I haven't taken this approach in my previous journeys and thought I would give it a go, as I feel writing about new concepts will aid and accelerate my understanding and retention.

# Transferable Skills
In approaching this learning process, I'm drawing on skills honed in my day job as a Digital Project Engineering Consultant:
* Thinking through complex problems
* Rapidly learning and assimilating new concepts
* Swiftly developing and validating solutions

These skills - quick learning, critical thinking, and solution validation - are proving invaluable as I navigate the complex field of Machine Learning. By applying this professional approach to my personal learning journey, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning while creating interesting projects along the way.

# Future Plans
Consequently, I'll be dedicating some of my free time to gaining a deep understanding of Machine Learning. I plan to delve into its various components, aiming to thoroughly comprehend each architecture and algorithm while building cool projects in the process. Throughout this journey, I'll document what I've learnt in my own words and perhaps create a few blog posts along the way.
